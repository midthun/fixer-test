# IMPORTANT!!

I did not add my API key to the repository, since I am not sure how Github react to this, I think they might restrict access to it if they find public api keys etc. Please to into `src/environment/environment.ts` and set your API key before running the application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.
